Reviewing the Spending Ranges (Per Student) % Overall Passing Rate, it is evident that the higher the spending per student does not correlate to higher average Passing rate, with the greatest Passing % being a the second lowest of $585-630 followed by the <$585 Per Student Spending.

For School Size % Overall Passing Rate, it is evident that the lower the amount of students the higher the average % Overall Passing Rate.

For School Type % Overall Passing Rate, the higher average % Overall Passing Rate were students from Independent Schools.

Conclusions that support the findings is that the 3 Bottom performing Schools are all Government, High Total Student schools with high spending.

This is in comparison to the Top performing schools were 3 out of the 5 were Independent, with below 2000 students and all top 5 fitting within the bottom 2 spending ranges.
